You are walking along a winding path. There are woods on either side of you that stretch on as far as you can see. Beautiful red, golden and yellow leaves adorn the tops and litter the ground—it is chilly. It hasn’t started snowing yet, but you can tell from the way the air smells that snow is coming. You have lived here a long time and can smell an imperceptible change like that. Most people cannot. This morning, you chose to adorn a red jacket and brown hunting cap because of this. You are far from your house, here. There’s a babbling brook some time away, but you can hear its chitter. It is not late enough into the winter that the creek is frozen solid. You look down at your hands. They are much older than you remember them being, but that’s okay. You touch your face. Your cheekbones are sunken but high, your lips like gashes. You remove your hand. No more touching your face, now.
