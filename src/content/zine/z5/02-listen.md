> With this worksheet, find somewhere quiet where you can be alone for around 15 minutes. Don't think too hard about these questions; they are meant to carry ideas from one place to another. When you are done, you may flip the paper over and read quietly at your desk.

1. The bees flit the last flap of their wings for the season, buzz out quietly and sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Where do they sleep?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For how long?

2. As they sleep, branches crackle; fireplace roars, fireplace settles, makes us think of...?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. With who?

3. Outside of the fireplace, leaves crack under someone's boots. They're boots we know well. Whose boots?

4. If the lake is frozen in the deep of November, are we imagining the slap of a fish jumping over a loon?

5. The sounds in this worksheet, in the room around us: list them. There are at least 3 but no more than 5.
