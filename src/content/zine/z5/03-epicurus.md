He deemed *what's real\
is what we sense* but let's\
be real what if

my sense is not his\
sense what if there's nothing\
in common between us not

even two cents worth no\
loose change I sense\
a worsening

of my senses my two\
ears loosen tonight\
in my dreams I too lose

delusions I let them loose\
from their roots pearly like the moon pink\
spheres duped on thoughtless pennies

Epicurus penned *the moon\
is nothing but a shining\
disc refracted from our eyes* I wonder

when he lends his ear\
to silence does he feel\
peaced like plated

peaches arranged in a fine\
science or a placated moon\
beaming because I'm in pieces

what does it mean if all I am loaned\
is not peace but instead screams\
a squealing appliance a moaning

of faucets leaking skin\
sinned off silver\
furred fruitless bats

what would Epicurus\
exclaim about that perhaps\
this whole world is undersea & aye

I am the only one\
reeling I reel my ears backward\
from the bathroom sink stack them

for the rats downstairs I wake\
my dreams to silence I try I\
try I try & I am
