The scene: a wall of shelves, stuffed and neatly lined with vinyl records. A leather armchair, vaguely Scandinavian in design. A thin, long desk (maple? oak? either way, the grain is pretty). A wooden foot with a spider image engraved in it from Laos. A Swiss flag mug. Stubby pencils kept in shot glasses. A bobblehead figure of Yasuhiro “Ryan” Ogawa.
