> “To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. . . . Photographed images do not seem to be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality that anyone can make or acquire.” Susan Sontag, On Photography (174).

The making of a photograph can be instantaneous: the click of a button, the snap of a shutter. It takes very little but a beautiful reality to make a beautiful photograph. It takes a lot more to consistently make well-crafted photographs. I think that a photograph is more than a thing photographed. I think it is a craft, in two parts.

There is the taking of the photograph, and there is the printing (or the editing, if you work more with digital). For me, taking the photograph is about choosing what piece of reality you think is art, and translating it into frame. It is a split-second decision. It is often a selection of one of four things: color, light, texture, or line. The frame as captured may not be perfect. Editing and printing serve to articulate the photographer’s focus. I have chosen and edited these photos to bring out color, light, texture, or line. I think you can see one of these four elements particularly clearly in each of these photos. I’ve also added captions explaining what I was thinking when taking the photograph— not very poetic. Some were taken very intentionally, others were happy accidents.

Of course, none of these photos are about these elements or what I was thinking when I took them. They’re about the beauty in my friends, and in these wonderful places. They’re about happiness and mystery, culture and surprise.
