Drawing makes me forget\
the first fifty years, more hardship\
than happiness. I’m not mad,\
nor possessed, nor useless.

I picked up a rock and\
scribbled out my old life.\
I’m a fairy tale or folk hero or\
whatever you wish to make of me.

My wife, I asked her permission\
to paint. I asked again and again.\
My wife, I must paint. I must.\
I need to make my life.

From my hands, faces bloomed\
on fields of red. Blue babies and\
fantastic hairstyles. Small people\
dancing in stripes, in polka dots.

I strung my paintings outside\
the temple, flags in the wind.\
I let the magazine interview me.\
I’m becoming holy.

I won’t sell I won’t\
sell I won’t sell I\
won’t.
