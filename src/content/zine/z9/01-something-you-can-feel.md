_after Mickalene Thomas_

I bejeweled this couch myself.\
Encrusted it in rhinestones.\
If you run your hands along the arms,\
you’ll feel each plastic stud.\
The upholstery—a family heirloom\
or a craft store bargain bin.\
I’m a hobbyist\
I’m an illegitimate child\
I’m a diamond painting\
I’m a museum acquisition\
I sparkle, I sparkle, I sparkle\
in every light\
I decide what I can afford.
