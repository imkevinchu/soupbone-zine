### In a Cabin

This yellow morning light mixes\
with blue water

rises with mist\
off the lake, dancing and twirling round.

Warm pink palms\
pale on my stomach,

when you let out a breath,\
I take it in.

The buzzing of the cicadas\
has gone quiet for the year.

Can’t you see the trees\
orange, red, yellow, green,

who planted them but God?\
I’m not a religious person.

Can’t you see the purple and dead\
on the ground, waiting

patiently to become soil\
for God’s next planting?

### Moment in the Mourning

Bird sings its repetitive call by the pond,\
watery eyes stilled, reflection of a mirror of clouds.

Honeysuckle slashes through the stench of stagnant water.\
Algae spreads on the clouds, a plague of green on fluffy white,\
pocked by pink bog lilies.

A carp's flittering body beneath\
and above my reflection —\
slides quickly away, leaving only a sunken\
shadow of me.

I am taking this moment to mourn.

How often does one see a bird so closely\
dipping up and down in a water dish,\
fly closely to the ground. I want to scream\
go up, go higher, take advantage\
of your wings — I don't know.

Maybe, "Move your sweet buttercup eyes\
toward the scorching light.

Like the crabapple roots stretch, straining to wrap themselves\
around earthworms, underground,\
chasing a spiraling and empty path, but go higher. Go up"

Snails wriggle along lavender stems —\
hunting for a sweet sip in the tiny purple cups —

in this moment I've taken to mourn.
