**_Cyborg Cento (Tiffany's Version)_**

I've never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi:\
artificial bloom, hydroponic skin, pretty

but sad inside---isn't she beautiful?\
Crashing slowly, your code is programmed

not to love the bugs in me, so I'll\
lick an angel just to purify again

Accepting the alien you've rejected\
You could be me and I could be you

We are so cute nice face:\
Immaterial girls (anyhow, any place)

Tell me, where do I exist?\
I'm real when I shop my face

I'll love you in this space and time\
I'll be your femmebot

I was just a lonely girl\
in the eyes of my inner child

How many lies must I become\
to roam all over my cyber fantasy

**_Cyborg Cento (Phoebe's Version)_**

I've never seen a hero\
like me in a sci-fi flicker,\
fever, fill the form of artificial\
bloom, hydroponic skin healing\
behind the armor that I hid\
behind how many lies I must become\
in this pretty but sad cyberworld.\
Take a byte: I'm that special\
drone inside the crashing fluorescence.\
I'll lick an angel just to purify my fantasy,\
a lonely girl free to roam all over\
pictures of the man that made her.\
When I shop my face, I'm real.\
When I say celestial, I mean extra-\
terrestrial, I mean accepting the alien\
you've rejected in your own heart.\
Tell me, where do I exist?

            *immaterial girls (anyhow, any place)*

                                                                                *immaterial boys (anywhere, anyone)*

                                                    *I'll be your femmebot*

*I am connected, I am the girl you want to watch*

                                                                                        *I'm an upgrade of your stereotype*

                                        *You could be me and I could be you*

        *We are so cute nice face*

                                                                        *that silеnce, sci-fi silence*

*I'll love you in this space and time*
