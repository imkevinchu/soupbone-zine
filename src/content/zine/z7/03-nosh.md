**Objective**: Be the first player to nosh your way to the center of the board!

**Setup/Building the board**:Â The board should be set up as a series of 5 concentric circles, with each circle being one of the flavor profiles above.

Before gameplay, have people bring a food that can be portioned into small sizes. Ask everyone why they brought that food. Place one piece of food on each space on the board based on the flavor profile. Each "circle" should have a different flavor profile. Create a "bridge" between each circle with a spoon or other utensil.

**Play**:

1.  The first player is the person with the best story behind the food they brought. The group votes on the best story.

2.  Roll a die. Using a hunk of your bread (or a gluten-free substitute) as a pawn, advance that many spaces, then draw a card from the deck. Follow the instructions on the card. On the first roll, if the number rolled is even, go counterclockwise. if the number rolled is odd, go clockwise.

3.  Move your piece that number of spaces. If there is food on the space you land on, take it and place it on your plate (and eat it if you want, or share with another player). If you decided to eat what you landed on, make sure to make a note of it and which level you found it! If you land on an empty space, progress to the next space occupied by food.

4.  If you encounter a spoon while advancing, you can only use the spoon to travel to the next circle if you have collected 3 prompts per circle.

5.  When you travel down a spoon, if the number you rolled is even, go counterclockwise. if the number rolled is odd, go clockwise.

6.  If you land on a spoon space that goes backward, you must regress to the previous circle. you must complete 1 prompt before traveling to the inner circle again.

7.  The first player to nosh their way to the center of the board and have an item from each circle wins!
