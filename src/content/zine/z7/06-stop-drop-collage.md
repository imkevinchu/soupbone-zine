</div>
<br>
 <div class="chat right">one of my first introductions to it was through tumblr, actually! i was a part of the ‚Äúart journal‚Äù crowd &amp; remember seeing a lot of really beautiful &amp; innovative spreads</div>
  <div class="chat right">now my collaging practice most often takes place outside of journals, but there was a span of 3-4 years where i kept art journals &amp; posted them online!</div>

  <div class="chat right">i was also an early fan of Rookie Mag‚Äôs collage kits</div>
  <div class="chat right">i remember being in awe of how they all got the ‚Äúbest stuff‚Äù for collaging, since so much of collaging ~au natural~ involves hours of flipping through old books &amp; magazines that might turn up nothing of interest, or not quite what you‚Äôd hoped for aesthetically</div>

<div class="chat right">when did you first hear abt collaging??</div>
<br>
<div class="chat left">Woahh now that I think about it, my first intro was also probably through tumblr! Maybe spreads with moody song lyrics‚Ä¶
</div>
  <div class="chat left">I probably also had some school assignments that involved collaging, but I didn‚Äôt really try it for myself until a couple of years ago during lockdown when I had more time to myself to make art
</div>
  <div class="chat left">I haven‚Äôt heard of the rookie mag kits actually!! I wish I had that! I feel like the hardest part of collaging is gathering source material‚ÄîI remember using some fortune cookie fortunes that I had saved in grade school &amp; feeling relieved that my grade school self [had] the foresight
</div>
<br>
<div class="chat right">hahaha I love that so much
</div>
  <div class="chat right">the impulse to save things simply because they might one day make it into a collage is REAL
</div>
  <div class="chat right">how often do you collage??
</div>
<br>  
  <div class="chat left">Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have too much time to collage that often :-( maybe only a couple of times a year</div>
  <div class="chat left">What about you? For me I only do it a couple of times a year because I‚Äôll usually take an entire day or an entire afternoon/night</div>
  <div class="chat left">I wish i had a lot more unstructured free time in my life ü•∫ but maybe i need to find ways to fit play into shorter timeframes</div>
<br>  
  <div class="chat right">mmm yes i often get around to it once a week or once every two weeks since i‚Äôve learned to be ok w picking up &amp; putting down the same piece over several sessions!</div>
  <div class="chat right">it‚Äôs tough though it is the kind of activity that i feel is best when you can really get absorbed into it</div>
  <div class="chat right">i‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat aspects of collaging feel like play to you?</div>
<br> 
  <div class="chat left">Ahhh i really need to practice returning to the same piece over multiple sessions‚ÄîI always feel this urge to do it in one sitting</div>
  <div class="chat left">I‚Äôm so dehydrated afterward</div>
  <div class="chat left">I like the act of sifting through magazines and random pages of things that I‚Äôve collected! I like the physicality of it, feeling what textures go together or cutting shapes out of images to play with negative space</div>
  <div class="chat left">And it‚Äôs fun to read articles from magazines that i use while i look through them‚Äîi probably wouldn‚Äôt have read them otherwise</div>
  <div class="chat left">Sometimes I‚Äôll come across a picture or a comic that will remind me of a friend, and it‚Äôs fun to cut them out to gift to them üíå</div>
  <div class="chat left">Are there any aspects of collaging that _don‚Äôt_ feel like play to you? And are there any source materials that you favor?</div>
<br>  
  <div class="chat right">excellent q! oddly enough it‚Äôs sometimes the physical demands of it (which seem minimal but definitely add up over time)--my neck gets super sore from hunching over pages &amp; as a lefty scissors are not in general made for me lol so after a while my hands hurt too</div>
  <div class="chat right">I happened to stumble upon a veritable TREASURE TROVE of collaging material about a month ago‚Äîsomeone had left a box of old gardening/photography/gemstone/outer space books on the sidewalk outside their house for anyone to take</div>
  <div class="chat right">so i of course scooped them right up</div>
  <div class="chat right">&amp; then had a collage-themed party w some friends which was excellent :)</div>

  <div class="chat left">The gemstone &amp; outer space books‚Ä¶To die for</div>
<div class="chat left">And yes i definitely relate to the physical demands of it‚Äîmy desk in my room isn‚Äôt big enough to hold all the materials I have open when I collage, so i end up sitting hunched over on the floor with everything</div>
<div class="chat left">I sit in the worst posture and after several hours my body gets so sore</div>
  <div class="chat left">Hmm I‚Äôd say that about half the time, i give my collages to my friends (usually I‚Äôll have constructed them with a specific friend in mind) or if it‚Äôs just for myself, i keep it glued in my sketchbook</div>
<div class="chat left">Once I made a zine with them!!! But that was a very involved effort where i had to take photos of all the collages, resize/edit them in illustrator, and then figure out how to print them as a booklet</div>
  <div class="chat left">As for tips, I‚Äôm someone who finds it helpful to have a prompt to work with‚Äîfor collaging, i make a prompt for myself by sifting through magazines/other texts and seeing if there are any words or phrases that stand out to me</div>
  <div class="chat left">One time i also made a collage based on one of ocean vuong‚Äôs poems (<a href="https://mmm.page/hz.ocean">https://mmm.page/hz.ocean</a>). Poems are nice because they‚Äôre already filled with imagery!</div>

  <div class="chat left">What‚Äôs your process like for getting started with collaging? Do you usually have a specific idea in mind before you begin?</div>
  <div class="chat left">I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of your pieces have a playful tone‚Äîi think it‚Äôs partially due to the recurring motifs of stars and hearts and other fun stickers. Are you intentional about that, like do you make something with the desire to have a certain kind of playful aesthetic?</div>
<br> 
  <div class="chat right">[re: the Ocean Vuong collages] THIS IS AMAZING</div>
  <div class="chat right">I‚Äôm noticing a really cool distinction in our collage styles‚ÄîI love how yours have so much unity and you craft a singular, coherent scene that fills the page</div>
  <div class="chat right">great q! not to go tortured artist‚Ñ¢ (tumblr teen‚Ñ¢?) on you, but the real answer is that i often reach for collaging when i‚Äôm trying to process a difficult emotion</div>
  <div class="chat right">often heartbreak- or love-adjacent</div>
  <div class="chat right">as it will be</div>
  <div class="chat right">we humans r so simple &amp; soft</div>
  <div class="chat right">but yeah! one time i made a series using texts from a person with whom i had/have a deeply complicated relationship &amp; ended up showing them‚Äîthey loved the collages, which was a sweet &amp; confusing feeling. like in my head i‚Äôd made these sort-of-damning collages laying their words bare, &amp; then they loved the art.</div>

  <div class="chat right">i was thrilled one time when i found a recipe for ‚Äúnaked ginger cake‚Äù in a food magazine to pair with a nude painting of a ginger in a book of klimt‚Äôs work</div>
  <div class="chat right">i love making little jokes out of the juxtaposition/proximity of different images</div>
  <div class="chat right">which reminds me!</div>
  <div class="chat right">i have this pet theory that collage is one of the mediums best suited to the ~current moment~ because in today‚Äôs world we‚Äôre almost inescapably inundated with images, phrases, ideas‚Äîand when you/if you turn to creating something of your own, often the most honest &amp;/or valuable thing you can do is offer up your own idiosyncratic curation of of the images you‚Äôve encountered. collage makes that curation physical/obvious‚Äîit‚Äôs like a physical trace of the unique pathway you took through the day‚Äôs/week‚Äôs/decade‚Äôs images.</div>
  <div class="chat right">how do you think about collage? does it feel like an old or new form of play to you, or somewhere in between? what feels different abt it to you than other mediums?</div>
<br>  
  <div class="chat left">we really are so simple and so soft :‚Äù)
</div>
  <div class="chat left">i wonder if the process of tearing apart paper or cutting things up adds to the catharsis of creating a collage</div>
  <div class="chat left">&amp; knowing that collage as a medium kind of defies ‚Äúperfection‚Äù in that it‚Äôs not necessary to cut edges perfectly or tear anything precisely</div>
  <div class="chat left">[re: M‚Äôs story abt making collage of a friend‚Äôs texts] OMG. was there a particular sort of reaction you were looking to elicit from them? i always feel so weird about showing people art or writing that is about them when it is not exactly written _for them_‚Ä¶i‚Äôm always a little scared to see how people will react</div>
  <div class="chat left">[re: ‚Äúnaked ginger‚Äù collage] this is FANTASTIC</div>
  <div class="chat left">[re: pet theory] yes, absolutely!! i just looked up the history of collage because i was curious, and i came across this article: <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/07/24/stick-em-up-a-surprising-history-of-collage#:~:text=Collage%20is%20often%20thought%20of,onto%20their%20canvases%20in%201912">https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/07/24/stick-em-up-a-surprising-history-of-collage#:~:text=Collage%20is%20often%20thought%20of,onto%20their%20canvases%20in%201912</a></div>
  <div class="chat left">(in the economist???)</div>
  <div class="chat left">it goes over the influence of collage in surrealism, the way it challenges highbrow/lowbrow art categories, and how it is also used as a protest medium. i thought this paragraph was interesting:</div>
  <div class="chat left">‚ÄúIn this still life, Picasso stuck a scrap of real newspaper onto the canvas. The viewer can stand and read the words, if they want. Whether the specific story, about the coronation of Tsar Alexander III in Russia, was intended to have any specific symbolic meaning remains a moot point. By introducing a real newspaper into the composition, rather than painting one, Picasso has conjured a world that exists in time as well as space.‚Äù</div>
  <div class="chat left">it‚Äôs kind of like what you were saying about the temporality of the medium‚Äîeven though you‚Äôre using objects and artworks that already exist, the end piece that you create will still be unique because of the way they‚Äôre put together</div>
  <div class="chat left">it‚Äôs both an artifact of your emotional state/thought processes and as well as a physical artifact of what existed in the world at the time you made the collage</div>
  <div class="chat left">[re: ‚Äúhow do you think abt collage?‚Äù q] i think collage feels like a relatively new form of play to me because i so strongly associate it with magazines with photos! since that‚Äôs what i mainly work with, but reading the article, it looks like it‚Äôs actually been around for centuries</div>
  <div class="chat left">i‚Äôm curious about the way collaging will change now that we upload so much of our artwork onto the internet‚Äîthe computer screen is inherently flat and will two dimensionalize (is that a word?) everything for the viewer, so the paper textures of collages and layering doesn‚Äôt come across as much</div>
  <div class="chat left">there‚Äôs this one neural network from openAI that got a lot of publicity called dallE, and i tried feeding it a collage prompt because i was curious</div>
  <div class="chat left">my prompt was ‚Äúa collage with a recipe for ginger cake and a woman with ginger hair in the style of klimt‚Äù</div>

  <div class="chat left">thinking about collaging as surrealism, how it blurs the lines between what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not, and how these models add another level of surrealism to it for the viewer‚Äîdid a real person make these? does it matter?</div>
<br> 
  <div class="chat right">yooooo these are INCREDIBLE</div>
  <div class="chat right">I love love love those last two questions (&amp; actually end up thinking about ‚Äúintention‚Äù a lot both in terms of my personal practice &amp; what i study‚Äîcontemporary experimental poetry)</div>
  <div class="chat right">i feel like w AI systems like dallE everything they produce is always already collage, if that makes sense‚Äîthey‚Äôre trained on images so every image they ‚Äúcreate‚Äù is a modification or perversion or average of the images they‚Äôve been fed</div>
  <div class="chat right">which is not that different from a person creating art, actually, if you want to get spooky/a little cynical!</div>
  <div class="chat right">there‚Äôs a line from Ginsberg‚Äôs ‚Äúa supermarket in california‚Äù that i love &amp; that feels applicable here: ‚Äúin my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images‚Ä¶‚Äù</div>
  <div class="chat right">collaging = shopping for images? life = shopping for images too, sometimes?</div>
  <div class="chat right">[re: ‚Äúwere you hoping for a specific reaction?‚Äù q] &amp; ha no, but i wonder if it speaks a little bit to how i think about the power of collage &amp; maybe links back into that Picasso quote you pulled out‚Äîon collage having the ability to situate something in time as well as space. making those collages felt like both dredging up something from the past and relegating it to the past (ik i‚Äôm in danger of not making sense here)--like once it‚Äôs on paper and framed aesthetically it becomes a relic again, of a past way of thinking or feeling or speaking that now serves a new purpose (to be reflected upon! to be surprised by! to take issue with! to be in dialogue with a bunch of flowers or a sticker of an old-time telephone or a receipt or what have you!)</div>
  <div class="chat right">i wonder whether we‚Äôre circling around the idea of collage sometimes feeling transgressive, in an oddly low-stakes way‚Äîboth in the activist way you looked into (so cool???) &amp; the sheer-pleasure-of-ripping-up-something-that-was-intended-to-be-whole way</div>
  <div class="chat right">maybe also this links into surrealism</div>
  <div class="chat right">&amp; not overly privileging or being too precious about reality?</div>

I saw this collage-esque exhibit once where an artist made patterns with tulip petals‚Ä¶so far, I‚Äôve only worked with various forms of paper, but I‚Äôd like to do more with nature, to explore temporality in a perhaps more immediate sense</div>
  <div class="chat left">I like being outside a lot, and from my experience of living in the city, i feel like i need to be extra extra intentional about allocating time to be Outside.
