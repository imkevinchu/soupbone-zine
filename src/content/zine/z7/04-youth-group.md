**Executive Summary**

The concept for Youth Group has been bouncing around in my head for a while, just because of how ridiculous it is, yet also how genius. Whenever I talk to people who were a part of the youth group I attended in high school, after a good amount of trauma-bonding and asking ourselves, "what the hell was that about?", we always reminisce over the games we played. So, I wondered, how come we never get the chance to play those games as an adult?

But, it's also about far more than the games. It's about having a community of people bonded by something---maybe it was God, maybe it was the awfulness of being a teenager, who knows. I wanted to come up with something that replicated the experience of a youth group lock-in, complete with games, moments for introspection, and team building exercises that somehow don't suck. Also, you can drink, so there's that. Or not, if that's also your vibe.

**Company Description**

Youth Group is a bar and entertainment center for young people to come together and enjoy the fun parts of belonging to a community, steeped in nostalgia and void of uncomfortable nights sleeping on the floor of the social hall or rug burn for sitting on the floor worshipping for hours.

Situated in an old church, preferably one built in the late mid-century whose congregation has petered out into nonexistence, Youth Group breathes new life into these spaces creating a laid-back, vibrant, and welcoming atmosphere. Just picture a mid-90s church, all beige walls and carpets that maybe were once maroon at one point in the past.

For many young people, the memories of times in middle school and high school spent attending youth group or going to church are complicated. While they might look back fondly on the games played, friendships formed, hours spent around others, they might also have experienced ostracization by the church or their peers because of their gender or sexual identity, pressure to conform to the group's dogma, or judgement based on other aspects of their life they have no control over.

At its core, Youth Group is a bar. Picture the opposite of the "trendy" coffee shop in your town that's secretly a front for a megachurch. It has a vaguely grungy vibe, much like "The Couch" that every youth group seemed to have which has definitely seen some things. The kitchen serves a elevated dive bar menu. It will serve a limited food menu at first, mostly riffs on classic Youth Group snacks. Grocery store doughnuts, Rice Krispie treats, Lofthouse cookies, Capri Suns, Sun Chips.

As far as games, there will be a rotating schedule of group games every night. Sardines, Ghosts in the Graveyard, Human Battleship, Ultimate Spoons, Grog, Elbow Tag, and more. To account for regional differences in games, there will be opportunities for patrons to suggest their favorite games growing up to be played by groups. Patrons can join games pick-up style, or reserve a session for their own crew---perfect for work team-building, bachelor/ette parties, and or just a night out.

**Competitive Analysis**

Other bars that provide entertainment and bands would be the primary competition for Youth Group. However, most bars have the standard assortment of bar games---pool, darts, cornhole, or perhaps electronic gambling machines. In addition, there are niche bars such as arcade bars which offer arcade and video games that can be played as groups. There are also other venues which combine fun activities with a social drinking such as bowling alleys or similar venues. As of my knowledge, no bars offer organized group games of the genre that Youth Group will.

**Market Analysis**

As of now,Â [29% of millennials have no religious affiliation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/29/millennials-lead-shift-away-from-organized-religion-as-pandemic-tests-faith.html), an increase of 6 points since 2016. This shows a growing number of the population of people who may have grown up in the church, participating in youth groups and games, but have since left.

However, the market of people missing out on "youth group games" extends beyond current and former church-goers. The types of group games played in youth groups across the country often overlap with other childhood activities such as scout troups and summer camps. This gives Youth Group a valuable opportunity to provide a place for adults to reconnect with their inner child.
