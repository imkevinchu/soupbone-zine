_Syllabi / Discussion Guides_

These documents began as mini syllabi for our internal discussions and have been adapted for public use. You can download and use them as guides or resources for your own conversations and research. If you would like to read the accompanying material referenced in these documents (articles, book excerpts, etc.), [send us an email](mailto:%20soupbonecollective@gmail.com) and we'll share those with you. We also welcome revisions and feedback. If you have suggestions, drop us a note!
