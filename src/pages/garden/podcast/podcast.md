A [show](https://anchor.fm/soupbone-collective/) from Genevieve Marvin and Tiffany Xie, two fresh-out-of-college English majors figuring out their gap years. It's about our insecurities, about feeling afloat in 2020. There will be quite a bit of poetry. A project of Soupbone, a humanities collective.
