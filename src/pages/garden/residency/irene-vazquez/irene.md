For the January-February 2021 residency, Irene featured a set of poems centered around the theme of "maps" on our homepage. A few parting gestures:

- A playlist, "[maps (they don't love you like the water loves you)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3B8m0a95pEbLoLDw0Zwlyv?si=c890fece5fcf4ee5)"

- A reading of "Dispatches," with audio accompaniment and editing by Damon Pham
