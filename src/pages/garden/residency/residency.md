title: "Soupbone Residents"
---

An archive of our residents from 2020 and 2021, with occasional gifts left behind. The Soupbone online residency was an opportunity for artists, writers, academics, and/or independent scholars to take over our homepage for two months. During the residency, we helped make virtual spaces for folks to share their work and provided opportunities to develop new projects.
