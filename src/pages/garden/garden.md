A digital garden is a space of care to which you continually return. This is our garden for the humanities. Currently, it contains several plots: a public commonplace book, a collection of learning resources, a podcast, and a residency archive. This garden is a living space; we're planning to grow and plant more in the future.

We're not the first to start a digital garden. [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about) uses the phrase in the sense of a public workspace. Adjacent inspirations include Jenny Odell's article [on how to grow an idea,](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/jenny-odell-how-to-grow-an-idea/) Tom Critchlow's [wikifolder,](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) and the fine folks at [A New Nothing](https://anewnothing.com/about/).

If you are able, we'd love to hear from you & know if any of these resources have been useful or interesting. You can also help us tend this garden by signing the [guest book](https://forms.gle/UTD3p3WC94trSnnc8). Thank you, always, for visiting.
