Words and recordings by Cindy, Phoebe, Margaret, Calla, Lauren, Kevin, Yeeseon, Katherine, Zuhra, and Holly. Audio editing and webpage by Damon.

The typeface we used is Qene-G by Balibilly Design. The title is a line from Mary Oliver's poem "Wild Geese," read from a mistaken text-to-speech transcript.
