**What is Soupbone?**

Soupbone is a distributed humanities collective founded in 2019. It is a group of friends who get together once in a while and make things at the intersections of research and lived experience.

**How can I get involved with Soupbone?**

If you would like to become a member, you can [email us](mailto:soupbonecollective@gmail.com) with a letter of interest. We are looking especially for members with a committment to (or strong interest in) scholarship, creative methodologies, and thinking about the humanities in a collaborative and public context. If you're interested in meeting the rest of the community, you can also join our Discord channel: just send us an email request! 

**Are you funded or supported by an institute or university?**

Nope! We are currently an independent group of friends and peers, scattered across countries, functioning out of our own pockets and spare time.

**Where did Soupbone come from?**

An [email newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/soupbone/letters/soupbone-an-introduction), to start.
