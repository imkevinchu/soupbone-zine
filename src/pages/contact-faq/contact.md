You can reach us [by email](mailto:soupbonecollective@gmail.com).

We are a leaderless collective and make decisions as a group. That said, we do have several organizational roles for the purpose of accountability:

> Phoebe and Cindy serve as Groundskeepers: they tend to the collective and ensure that everything runs smoothly. Calla, Genevieve, and Yeeseon serve as Social Media Coordinators: they look after our online posts and presence. Melissa is our lovely portraitist. While we had bi-monthly discussions during 2020 and 2021, Margaret, Shawn, Maddy, and Zuhra served as our Discussion Coordinators, creating spaces for generative conversation.

We are on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soupbonecollective/) and [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/soupboneco)
