The best way to reach us is [by email](mailto:soupbonecollective@gmail.com)! We are also on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soupbonecollective/) and [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/soupboneco)

We are a leaderless collective and make decisions as a group. That said, we do have several organizational roles for the purpose of accountability:

> Phoebe and Cindy serve as Groundskeepers: they tend to the collective and ensure that everything runs smoothly. Calla, Genevieve, and Yeeseon serve as Social Media Coordinators. While we had bi-monthly discussions during 2020 and 2021, Margaret and Shawn served as our Discussion Coordinators.

Melissa drew our member portraits, and Margaret made the homepage collage! This website is collaboratively built and maintained by Kevin, Damon, and Phoebe.
