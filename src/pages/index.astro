      <h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
      <p>
        My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll
        give you something to cry about you little bastard! Hey, take a look at
        the earthlings. Goodbye! You're a very talented young man, with your own
        clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?
      </p>

        Did he just throw my cat out of the window? What do they got in there?
        King Kong? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates
        Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. This thing comes fully
        loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

        You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and
        ideas. Do you need a manager? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs
        on your dinosaur tour, right? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the
        Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don‚Äôt eat the tourists.
