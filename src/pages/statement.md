description: "Soupbone cultivates digital communities to engage with and reimagine the humanities"
---

Soupbone is founded on the belief that a supportive community can foster creative thought. To that end, we make zines, host workshops, and share work that excites us among ourselves and with the public at large. We are particularly focused on engaging with emerging scholars and artists, as well as those with limited access to a humanities education.

We ponder and play with the humanities. We cultivate digital gardens in virtual spaces. We hold the lenses of the humanities up to everyday life and the world at large. Our members brainstorm, experiment, and make things with others. We see the collaborative study of the humanities as a way to empower and educate, as a space which leaves us open to wonder.

##### Who We Are

> Soupbone is an online humanities collective founded in 2019. It is a group of lifelong students working to explore the intersections of scholarship and lived experience. Currently, it takes the form of a collaborative studio and workshop for sharing ongoing academic and artistic projects.
