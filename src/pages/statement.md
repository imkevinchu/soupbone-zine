Soupbone is an online humanities collective founded in 2019. We are lifelong students exploring the intersections of scholarship, lived experience, and creativity. Currently, Soupbone takes the form of a collaborative studio and workshop for sharing ongoing academic and artistic projects that engage with and reimagine the humanities.
